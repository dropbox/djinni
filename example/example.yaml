# This is an example YAML file for being imported in other projects.
# It holds all necessary information for Djinni to integrate foreign types into the generated code.
# All fields are mandatory.
---
# The name to refer to this type in other .djinni files.
# It must be unique in the entire Djinni run, so you should pick a unique prefix for your framework/library.
name: mylib_record1
# Specifies what kind of type this is.
# Supports the same syntax as is used to declare types in .djinni files.
# Examples: 'interface +c', 'record deriving(eq, or)', 'enum', 'flags', 'interface +j +o'
# This determines how Djinni integrates this type into function parameters, fields or return types and operators.
typedef: 'record +c deriving(eq, ord)'
# The (potentially empty) list of required type parameters.
params: [type_param1, type_param2]
# This string is stripped from the value specified under "name" to ensure Djinni is referencing the correct typename in code.
# May be an empty string if you don't have a prefix (bad!)
prefix: 'mylib'
cpp:
  # The name of this type in C++ (without template arguments). Should be fully qualified.
  typename: '::mylib::Record1'
  # The header required in C++ to use your type. Must include "" or <>.
  header: '"MyLib/Record1.hpp"'
  # Only used for "record" types: determines whether it should be passed by-value in C++.
  # If this is false it is always passed as const&

  # The name of this type in Objective-C.

  # The header required in Objective-C to use your type.
  header: '"MLB/MLBRecord1.h"'
  # Only used for "record" types: determines the type used when boxing the record is required.
  # Should not contain the pointer asterisk "*", protocols are not supported.
  # This files is the same as "typename" most of the time as records are typically NSObjects and require no special boxing.
  # However, some may not, for example NSTimeInterval is boxed to NSNumber.
  boxed: 'MLBRecord1'
  # Specifies whether the unboxed type is a pointer.
  pointer: true

  typename: 'com.example.mylib.Record1'
  # Only used for "record" types: determines the type used when boxing the record is required.
  # This field is the same as "typename" most of the time as records are typically Objects and require no special boxing.
  # However maybe your record has a dedicated boxed type and this field allows you to control that.
  boxed: 'com.example.mylib.Record1'
  # If this is true "typename" is an Object reference (and not a builtin).
  reference: true
  # Controls whether the type parameters as specified in "params" are forwarded as generics to Java.
  # This is useful when templates are only used in C++ (e.g. std::chrono::duration<rep, period> versus java.time.Duration)
  # This should be true by default (even if your type has no parameters) and only set to false if required
  generic: true
