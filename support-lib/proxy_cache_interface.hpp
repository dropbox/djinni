 * If custom wrapper types are used, like the `JavaWeakRef` type in the JNI library, then
 * they must implement `.get()` or `.lock()` by analogy with C++'s smart pointers.
 *
 * We assume that built-in types are pointer-compatible. This is the case with ObjC: for
 * example, __weak id pointers can be implicitly converted to __strong id, and so on.

/*
 * ProxyCache provides a mechanism for re-using proxy objects generated in one language
 * that wrap around implementations in a different language. This is for correctness, not
 * just performance: when we pass the same object across a language boundary twice, we want
 * to get the same proxy object on the other side each time, so that identity semantics
 * behave as expected.
 *
 * ProxyCache is instantiated with a Traits class that must contain the following typedefs.
 * Examples refer to the use of ProxyCache to cache C++ wrappers around ObjC objects.
 * ProxyCache itself is generic (type-erased), though Handle is not, so we use e.g. `id`
 * and `shared_ptr<void>` rather than any specific types.
 *
 * - UnowningImplPointer:
 *       a non-owning pointer to an object being wrapped, e.g. __unsafe_unretained id
 * - OwningImplPointer:
 *       a strong owning pointer to an object being wrapped, e.g. __strong id
 * - OwningProxyPointer:
 *       a strong owning pointer to a wrapper, e.g. std::shared_ptr<void>
 * - WeakProxyPointer:
 *       a safe weak pointer to a wrapper, e.g. std::weak_ptr<void>
 * - UnowningImplPointerHash:
 *       a hasher for UnowningImplPointer, usually std::hash<UnowningImplPointer>, unless
 *       std::hash doesn't work with UnowningImplPointer in which case a custom type can be
 *       provided.
 * - UnowningImplPointerEqual:
 *       an equality predicate for UnowningImplPointer, like std::equal_to<UnowningImplPointer>.
 *       In some cases (e.g. Java) a custom equality predicate may be needed.
 *
 * Generally, ProxyCache will be explicitly instantiated in one source file with C++11's
 * `extern template` mechanism. The WeakProxyPointer, UnowningImplPointerHash, and
 * UnowningImplPointerEqual types can be incomplete except for where the explicit
 * instantiation is actually defined.
 *
 * Here's an overview of the structure:
 *
 *                           ______________  std::pair<ImplType,
 *          WeakProxyPonter |              | UnowningImplPointer>
 *           - - - - - - - -|  ProxyCache  |- - - - - - - - - -
 *          |               |              |                   |
 *          |               |______________|                   |
 *          |                                                  |
 *      ____v____        ______________          ______________v__________
 *     |         |      |              |        |                         |
 *     | (Proxy  | ===> | ProxyCache:: | =====> | (Impl object providing  |
 *     | object) |  ^   |   Handle<T>  |   T    |  actual functionality)  |
 *     |_________|  .   |______________|   ^    |_________________________|
 *                  .                     .
 *     ( can be member, base, )       ( T is a generally a specific   )
 *     ( or cross-language    )       ( owning type like id<Foo>,     )
 *     ( reference like jlong )       ( shared_ptr<Foo>, or GlobalRef )
 *
 * The cache contains a map from pair<ImplType, UnowningImplPointer>
 * to WeakProxyPointer, allowing it to answer the question: "given this
 * impl, do we already have a proxy in existence?"
 *
 * We use one map for all translated types, rather than a separate one for each type,
 * to minimize duplication of code and make it so the unordered_map is as contained as
 * possible.

     * Each proxy object must own a Handle. The Handle carries a strong reference to whatever
     * the proxy wraps. When `ProxyCache::get()` creates a proxy, it also adds the proxy to
     * the global proxy cache; Handle::~Handle() removes the reference from the cache.
     *
     * The Handle can be held by the proxy in any of a number of ways: as a C++ member or
     * base, as an ObjC instance variable, or across an FFI boundary (a Java object might
     * contain the address of a Handle as a `long` and delete it in the destructor.)

     * proxy class `MyInterface` which wraps `@protocol DBMyInterface` would contain a

     * allocator will create a GlobalRef to the impl object and store it in the returned proxy.
     *
