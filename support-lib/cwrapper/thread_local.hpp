 * destroy a ThreadLocal. (This is because destroying a ThreadLocal would require tracking
 * down the instances of T that exist for every other thread, which would add overhead. The
 * ThreadLocal object uses an address tag in a per-thread map to track which objects belong
 * to which ThreadLocal. When a ThreadLocal is destroyed, each thread's instances will stay
 * around - but if another ThreadLocal is ever created at the same address, objects that the
 * old one owned will be confused with the new one, even if they're of a different type.)
